#  What is a Regexp?

{{img "doggie-and-kittie.jpg" height="300"}}

A regular expression (or *regexp*, or *regex*), is a pattern
that can be matched against a string. In other words, the regular expression
pattern specifies what we're looking for, and we can apply that pattern to one
or more strings to see if they contain that pattern.

For example, we could create a regexp that matches any string that contains
either "cat" or "dog". We could then apply that regexp to various strings. If
we applied it to the string `"My cat"`, it would match (and we could probably
find out that it matched at the 3rd character in the string, where characters
are numbered starting at 0. {{footnote 1}} We could apply the same regexp to
the string `"catastrophic"` and get a match at position zero (because we
didn't construct our regexp to look only for complete words when matching).
{{footnote 2}}

{{#footnote 1}}
```ruby
"My cat"  # string to match
cat       # pattern
012345    # character offset
```
{{/footnote}}

{{#footnote 2}}
```ruby
"catastrophe"  # string to match
cat            # pattern
012345         # character offset
```
{{/footnote}}

But apply it to `"c.a.t."` or `"Doggy"` and the match will fail.
In the first case, the letters are there, but our pattern wanted them to be
consecutive. In the second case, the string contains an uppercase D and our
pattern looked for a lower case one. (We'll see later how to make pattern
matches ignore the case of letters.)

## A Quick Recap

The key point to remember is that a regular expression is a   pattern that can
be matched against one of more strings.

{{#quiz-choose-many}}
Which of the following patterns would match the string `"The quick brown fox"`?
---
- text: the
  error: the pattern has lower-case 'the', and the string has 'The'
- text: own
  accept: true
- text: fox!
  error: there's no exclamation mark in the string
- text: BROWN
  error: "'brown' in the string is lower case"
